I will define %OPENCV_TRAINING% as the folder where the opencv training programs are
(I tried to use an environment variable but i'm too dumb to run the code with it)

Mine is: C:\Users\[YOUR_USER_HERE]\opencv\build\x64\vc15\bin\

# Annotation:

%OPENCV_TRAINING%opencv_annotation.exe --annotations=annotation_file.txt --images=pathtoimagesfolder

# Samples Creation

%OPENCV_TRAINING%opencv_createsamples.exe -info pos.txt -w 24 -h 32 -num 250 -vec pos.vec

where:
-num has to be bigger than the total number of rectangles annotated
-vec is the vector file input that the cascade training will receive

# Training

%OPENCV_TRAINING%opencv_traincascade.exe -data ./training_results/training2/ -vec ./training_results/training2/pos.vec -bg neg.txt -w 24 -h 32 -numPos 180 -numNeg 360 -numStages 18

i took an advise to put numPos as a subset of the total positive images and numNEg twice the amount of numPos
